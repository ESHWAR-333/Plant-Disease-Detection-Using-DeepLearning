# ⭐ Plant-Disease-Detection-Using-DeepLearning
Crop diseases pose a significant threat to global food security, particularly in areas where 
infrastructure is limited. To address this challenge, a platform for accurately identifying plant 
diseases is needed. "Deep Learning Plant Disease Detection" is a platform that uses deep learning 
techniques to identify plant diseases. The platform uses the "CNN" algorithm, widely known for 
its high accuracy in image classification, enabling it to identify plant diseases from
images accurately. Furthermore, the platform offers recommendations for preventing and provides 
supplements for that disease and managing the spread of crop diseases using its user-friendly web 
interface. For Training, we are using the "Plant Village" dataset

## ⭐Testing Images

* If you do not have leaf images then you can use test images located in test_images folder
* Each Image has its disease name so you can verify whether the model is working perfectly or not.
